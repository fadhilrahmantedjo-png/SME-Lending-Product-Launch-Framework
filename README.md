# SME Lending Product Launch Framework (Indonesia)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository documents a standardized **Program Management Framework** for launching SME financing products within the Indonesian regulatory landscape. It is designed to bridge the gap between **OJK (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan)** compliance requirements and agile product development cycles.

**Objective:** To streamline the end-to-end product lifecycle—from initiation to go-to-market—while maintaining a Non-Performing Financing (NPF) ratio below industry thresholds.

## 🛠 Phase 1: Initiation & Regulatory Scoping
Before any product development begins, a strict regulatory feasibility study is conducted to ensure alignment with Indonesian lending laws (Fintech & Banking).

### Key Regulatory Checkpoints (OJK)
* **POJK No. 10/POJK.05/2022:** The primary regulation for IT-Based Co-Funding Services (Fintech Lending / LPBBTI). Focus on:
    * **Batas Maksimum Pemberian Pendanaan (BMPP):** ensuring lending limits are respected.
    * **Risk Mitigation:** Mandatory credit scoring and insurance/guarantee requirements.
* **SEOJK No. 19/SEOJK.06/2023:** Compliance regarding ethical collection practices (Billing/Debt Collection standards).
* **POJK No. 13/POJK.03/2021:** If the product involves **Channeling** (Bank collaboration), ensuring the "Cooperation with Third Parties" clause is met.

**Deliverable:** *Product Requirement Document (PRD) v1.0 - Legal & Compliance Sign-off.*

## 📊 Phase 2: Risk Management Architecture
Defining the credit risk parameters using the **5C Principles of Credit** adapted for digital/hybrid lending ecosystems.

| Risk Component | Metric / Validation Method | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Character** | SLIK OJK (BI Checking) & Alternative Data | Automated blacklist filtering & e-KYC verification. |
| **Capacity** | Cash Flow Analysis, Debt Service Ratio (DSR) | Threshold limits set at < 35% of monthly net income. |
| **Capital** | Business Equity & Asset Valuation | Minimum down payment (DP) requirements for asset financing. |
| **Collateral** | Appraisal Value vs. Liquidation Value | Conservative LTV (Loan-to-Value) limits based on asset class. |
| **Condition** | Macroeconomic Factors (Inflation, Sector Risk) | Sector capping (e.g., limiting exposure to volatile industries). |

## 🚀 Phase 3: Execution Strategy (Program Management)
Managing the timeline and cross-functional stakeholders using a **Waterfall-Agile Hybrid** approach.

### Stakeholder Communication Matrix
* **C-Level / Steering Comm:** Monthly steering committee presentations on portfolio health and milestone tracking.
* **Product & Engineering:** Weekly sprints to align technical build with business logic and credit scoring rules.
* **Risk & Compliance:** Bi-weekly checkpoints to review "Early Warning Signals" (EWS) parameters.
* **Operations/Sales:** Training on SOPs for loan origination and document verification.

### Typical Launch Timeline
1.  **Month 1:** Scoping, Market Research, and Regulatory Feasibility (POJK Check).
2.  **Month 2:** Credit Model Development & Operational SOP Drafting.
3.  **Month 3:** Pilot Launch (Sandbox Environment) & User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
4.  **Month 4:** Commercial Launch & Post-Implementation Review (PIR).

## 📈 Performance Monitoring & Optimization
Post-launch tracking of success metrics to ensure portfolio health.

* **Financial Metrics:** ROI, Net Interest Margin (NIM), Fee-based Income.
* **Risk Metrics:** TKB90 (Success Rate) vs. TWP90 (Default Rate), Cost of Credit.
* **Operational Metrics:** Turn Around Time (TAT), Approval Rate vs. Application Rate.
