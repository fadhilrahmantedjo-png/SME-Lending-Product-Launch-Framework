# SME Lending Product Launch Framework (Indonesia)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository documents a standardized **Program Management Framework** for launching SME financing products within the Indonesian regulatory landscape. It is designed to bridge the gap between **OJK (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan)** compliance requirements and agile product development cycles.

**Objective:** To streamline the end-to-end product lifecycle—from initiation to go-to-market—while maintaining a Non-Performing Financing (NPF) ratio below industry thresholds.

## 🛠 Phase 1: Initiation & Regulatory Scoping
Before any product development begins, a strict regulatory feasibility study is conducted to ensure alignment with Indonesian banking laws.

### Key Regulatory Checkpoints (OJK)
* **POJK No. 57/POJK.03/2020:** Digital Banking Implementation & Risk Management.
* **POJK Compliance:** Reviewing capital requirements and risk-weighted assets (ATMR).
* **Sharia Compliance (If applicable):** Verification with the Sharia Supervisory Board (DPS) regarding *Akad* (contract) validity.

**Deliverable:** *Product Requirement Document (PRD) v1.0 - Legal & Compliance Sign-off.*

## 📊 Phase 2: Risk Management Architecture
Defining the credit risk parameters using the **5C Principles of Credit** adapted for digital/hybrid lending ecosystems.

| Risk Component | Metric / Validation Method | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Character** | BI Checking (SLIK OJK), Credit History | Automated blacklist filtering & KYC verification. |
| **Capacity** | Cash Flow Analysis, Debt Service Ratio (DSR) | Threshold limits set at < 35% of monthly net income. |
| **Capital** | Business Equity & Asset Valuation | Minimum down payment (DP) requirements for asset financing. |
| **Collateral** | Appraisal Value vs. Liquidation Value | Conservative LTV (Loan-to-Value) limits based on asset class. |
| **Condition** | Macroeconomic Factors (Inflation, Sector Risk) | Sector capping (e.g., limiting exposure to volatile industries). |
